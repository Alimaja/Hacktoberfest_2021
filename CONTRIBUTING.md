## Quality Standards

In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of the pull requests that we consider to be low quality contributions (which we discourage and may be marked as spam by maintainers).

### examples of low quality contributions

‚ùå Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.    
‚ùå Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.     
‚ùå Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.     
‚ùå Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.      
‚ùå Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
